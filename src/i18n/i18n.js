          "Zhejiang Yuntu Air Vehicle Technology Co., Ltd. was founded in 2021 with the vision to \"create the era of flight\". The company is dedicated to developing new generation of electric ducted fan propulsion systems and aircraft with independent intellectual property rights for urban transportation, logistics, and specialized industries. Its products are characterized by being green, high efficiency, safety, and low noise.\n\nThe company's core product is electric ducted fan propulsion systems that are devel- oped entirely in-house. Its performance is distinguished, and it can be applied to eVTOL, General Aviation aircraft, UAV, airship, and airboat. \n\nThe founding team members all came from Beihang University (formerly Beijing Uni- versity of Aeronautics and Astronautics). The company's engineering center is located at the Yangtze River Delta Industrial Cooperation Zone (Huzhou, Zhejiang Province), while the R&D center is based on the professional laboratory of Beihang University to develop cutting-edge technology.
